    <p>
    One of the highlights of my academic career includes the publication of my research paper, "Innovation Meets Healthcare: MedVision," in the prestigious "International Journal of Advanced Multidisciplinary Research and Studies." This groundbreaking project revolutionizes medical education by leveraging augmented reality (AR) to create immersive 3D models of vital organs. These models provide a comprehensive visual aid for medical students, enhancing their understanding and engagement with anatomical structures. The project's mobile-friendly interface and interactive assessment modules promise to redefine medical training, preparing future healthcare professionals more effectively for clinical practice.</p>
    <p>KEY FEATURES</p>
    <p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> Focus on 3D models for presentation of six organs: heart, brain, spinal cord, kidney, lungs and intestine.</li>
        <li>All-round visual aid for better understanding and study of anatomical structures.</li>
        <li>Mobile-friendly feature that allows users to experience the 3D models in AR.</li>
        <li>Module concentrates on assessment by incorporating multiple-choice questions tailored for each organ model out of the six.</li>
        <li>Innovative approach holds promise in advancing the quality and effectiveness of medical training programs, preparing future healthcare professionals more adeptly for clinical practice.</li>
        <li>On mobile phones provides real-time visual representation of models making learning more interesting. Incorporating augmented reality technology adds another level to the education process thus allowing students to engage with physical structures.</li>
        <li>Chatbot made for clarification of student doubts and additional information about the modules. </li>
        <li>Each organ model has specific hotspots that can be clicked to zoom the user's attention to selected parts of interest. Relevant data related to the place selected by a hotspot would appear on the screen.</li>
    </ol>
